# D-D-Resume-Parser
An automated resume parsing web app that analyzes and ranks candidates based on skills.
🚀 Overview

D&D Parser is my first fully working project, built after learning Frontend and Python.
It allows HRs or recruiters to upload resumes (PDF, DOCX, or TXT), extract and clean the content, and instantly generate a Match % score for each candidate based on user-defined skills.

⚙️ Features

📂 Upload multiple resumes at once (Batch Mode)

🧾 Supports .pdf, .docx, and .txt formats

🔍 Built-in OCR using Tesseract for scanned resumes

🧠 Uses NLTK for text cleaning and keyword analysis

⚡ Displays candidate ranking by Match %

🖥️ User-friendly web interface

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask)
Libraries & Tools: PyPDF2, python-docx, NLTK, PyTesseract (OCR)

🧩 How It Works

HR enters required job skills (e.g. “Python”, “Flask”).

Upload resumes (single or multiple).

The backend extracts, cleans, and analyzes text.

The system calculates a Match % score for each resume.

Results are displayed in a clean, sortable table for quick review.
